# Files generated by asn1c go here

C files extracted from the zip archive from asn1_codec are extracted here for use by IDEs.

Not persisted to version control.

To compile for Windows run the script `prepare-for-windows.sh` script to remove files
related to GeneralizedTime, and edit the file `pdu_collection.c` to remove the lines:

```c
extern struct asn_TYPE_descriptor_s asn_DEF_Period;
extern struct asn_TYPE_descriptor_s asn_DEF_AggregatedSingleTariffClassSession;
extern struct asn_TYPE_descriptor_s asn_DEF_DetectedChargeObject;
```
